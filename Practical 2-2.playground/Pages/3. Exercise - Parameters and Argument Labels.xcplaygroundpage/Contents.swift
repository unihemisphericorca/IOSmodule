/*:
## Exercise - Parameters and Argument Labels
 
 Write a new introduction function called `introduction`. It should take two `String` parameters, `name` and `home`, and one `Int` parameter, `age`. The function should print a brief introduction. I.e. if "Jenny," "California," and 32 were passed into the function, it might print "Jenny, 32, is from California." Call the function and observe the printout.
 */
func introduction (name: String, home: String, age: Int){
    print("\(name), \(age), is from \(home).")
}

introduction(name: "Jenny", home: "California", age: 32)

//:  Write a function called `almostAddition` that takes two `Int` arguments. The first argument should not require an argument label. The function should add the two arguments together, subtract 2, then print the result. Call the function and observe the printout.
//func almostAddition (x: Int = 6, y: Int) -> Int{
//    return x + y - 2
//}
//print(almostAddition(y: 9))

func almostAddition (x: Int = 6, y: Int){
    print( x + y - 2 )
}
almostAddition(y: 9)
//:  Write a function called `multiply` that takes two `Double` arguments. The function should multiply the two arguments and print the result. The first argument should not require a label, and the second argument should have an external label, `by`, that differs from the internal label. Call the function and observe the printout.
func multiply (_ num1: Double, by num2: Double) {
    print(num1 * num2)
}

multiply(7.2, by: 1.5)
